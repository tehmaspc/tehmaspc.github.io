I moved back to Colorado in June of 2011 for a job at a great company with a bit of a shift in my engineering career. The main reason for moving back to Colorado was for this very reason. However, sometimes I like to tell folks that one reason for my move back was for all the great beer and the beer culture that generally permeates Colorado. It’s a great place for beer lovers to really enjoy some great stuff and watch the re-emergence of American craft beer.

So, I captured a list of the top twenty five beers that I have really enjoyed this past year. I’m a hop-head, so most of these beers are stronger beers and a few of the beers below are here because of the enjoyment they provided me during various vacations and trips. The list of beers come from a handful of (mainly Coloradan) breweries and there’s a bunch more that I have enjoyed – but I decided to cap this list to twenty five. You can find more of my favorite and not so favorite beers on my Untappd profile page:
