I found some Ops, DevOps, & NoOps articles very good and interesting reads to get an idea of how different folks in the Web industry view and implement the traditional **Systems Operations** role.

Read them in the following order:

* [Adrian Cockcroft (NoOps)][noops]
* [John Allspaw (Ops/DevOps)][ops_devops]
* [Mike Loukides (DevOps)][devops]
